# Super Simple Unity Solar System Simulation


Solar System Simulation project from the coursera course: introduction to Game Development Michigan State University. 
My version is a bit different from the original, it has background music and a simple UI from a unity tutorial and 
other resources.


*Here's a gif of the simulation system:*
